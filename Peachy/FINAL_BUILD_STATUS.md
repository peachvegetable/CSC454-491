# Final Build Status

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Quest Model Visibility
- Quest struct is public and in correct location
- PulseView and PulseViewModel can access it

### 2. ✅ ShareHobbyFactSheet Parameters
- Has correct signature: `init(hobby: HobbyPresetItem, onDone: @escaping (String) -> Void)`
- onDone is non-optional with @escaping
- Simplified to just call onDone(fact) and dismiss

### 3. ✅ HobbyModel Realm Persistence
- Uses `RealmSwift.List<String>` instead of Set
- All read/write operations use proper List methods
- Schema version bumped to 2

### 4. ✅ PointService Implementation
- PointServiceProtocol defined with award/total methods
- MockPointService implements full functionality
- Integrated into ServiceContainer

### 5. ✅ ServiceContainer Initialization
- All services created in correct order
- Dependencies injected after initialization
- No circular references during init

### 6. ✅ UI Quest Completion State
- SuggestedQuestCard shows "✅ Completed" when done
- Button disabled after completion
- Quest status refreshes after sheet dismisses

## App Flow

1. **Pulse Screen**
   - Shows mood wheel if no mood logged
   - Shows "Today" card with mood if logged
   - Shows quest card with Start/Completed state

2. **Quest Flow**
   - Tap "Start Quest" → QuestDetailView
   - Select hobby → Continue → ShareHobbyFactSheet
   - Enter fact → "Mark Done" → Awards points
   - Returns to Pulse showing "✅ Completed"

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Mood logs append (not replace)
   - Quest completion tracked in Realm
   - Points accumulated per user
   - Flash cards created from facts
